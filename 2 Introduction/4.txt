Time complexity
It totally depend on work done ,It is represented as order of() or bigo of ()
Best case is 0(1).

Never decide time complexity after seeing the no of loops for eg(i=n,i>1,i/2)
Here you see the the time complexity is supposed to be 0(n), but in reality it is 0(logn)
some standard time complexities 
1>1 loop=0(n)
2>2 loop=0(n2)
3>3 loop=0(n3)

see the code and then calculate the time complexity

Space complexities
It is calculatated  using number of elements as we can say that same as order ().
