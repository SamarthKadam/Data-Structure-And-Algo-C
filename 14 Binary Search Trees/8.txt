If you want to delete
the nodes in the given
binary tree you can
delete them like you
can easily delte leaf
nodes it becomes
difficult when deleting
root nodes so you decide


predecssor or successor
predecceso=first go left
of the root,then go to
the right most of the child
it is predeccsor

succesor=first go right of the root
and then go to the left most node of
the root it successor

These are only two places where you can delete the main root node
