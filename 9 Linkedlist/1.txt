So why we have linked list ,we can use array?
So when we declare array we need to declare fixed size,or user need to enter 
the size of the array.What if user did not want to to enter the size,this is 
where linkedlist comes to play ,here we need not required to declare the size
of it.

What is linked list?
Linked list is collection of nodes where each nodes contains data and pointer
to next node;

Self referential structure are used in linked list


Important point on the c++ concepts
So we see what's the difference between private and public ,So private is only
accessed by the constructer and that's the major diff between structure and 
classes 
Structure variable's are public variables accessible.
