Array representation by the compiler
How does the array identify 
like 

1>
int A[10];(incase of i=0)
Imagine now I  want to assign A[3]=0, So how will the compiler know . It doesn't
know its name of A  Computer uses genral formula. That is 
A[3]=A(address)+n*sizeof(int);

2>
if(i=1)
Then the formula changes to 
A[3]=(address)+(n-1)*sizeof(int);

Computers mostly uses 1st case that is initilize using 0 ,if initilized from 1
then it has to perfrom 3 operations which is more as compared to 1st;

For 2D arrays compiler uses row major
While both of them takes same time
HORNERS rule
This rule help us to reduce the multiplication by reducing or taking commen terms
