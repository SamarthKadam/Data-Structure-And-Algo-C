Terminology
Tree is a colection of nodes or vertices and edges
if there are n nodes then there are n-1 edges(because root doesn't have edge co
ming from any parent)
1>Root
2>Parent
3>Child
4>Sibling
5>Descendent=All nodes under that nodes
6>Ancenstors=Allthe path from that node to ancestor node
7>Degree of node=No of children (What is degree of tree)It can be decided by no max
degree of that tree
8>Internal(non-leaf)(degree>0)/Extrenal nodes(leaf)(degree 0)
9>Levels of tree (we just count path)
10>height of tree (Here we count edges)
11>Forest (collection of trees are called forest) if we assign a top ancestor for
these forest then these will be called tree

Binary Tree
Binary tree is a tree having 0,1,2 children not more than that
Even if can define it as tree having degree 2 is called Binary tree

M arry tree
This means that the that the node can have a hightest of 3 childrens  not
more than that ,it also can have less then 3 children (then we will call
it as binary but no.Like M arry tress it is predecided.

Strict 3arry tree
it means that the node in that tree can have only 3 children or 0 children but no
1 or 0


Full binary tree is complete binary tree
But complete binary tree need not be a full binary tree


3>Binary tree traversal method 3
So for Preorder we have to take pointer that is our index finger of our
left and and point it to right now where all does this pointer meet write the
char

for inorder pointer to the up
for postorder pointer to the left using right hand
