Adjustment in the memory is called padding , Like a inside structrure variable take extra memory like in case if you see
struct rectangle{
int lenght;
int breadth;
char c;
};

struct rectangle r;
if you check the size of the r then expected would be 9 but it is 12 The machine takes the extra memory but use only 1 bytes;

So why we need a pointer
1>Pointers are used for accessing heap memory
2> For accessing resources
3>Pointers are also used for paramter passing
