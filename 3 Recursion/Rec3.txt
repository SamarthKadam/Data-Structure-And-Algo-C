Statement above function will execute at (Ascending) Calling time, below will exectute at return time(Descending)
What is difference between loop and recursion
both are repeating statements .Diffrence is that 
Loop will have ascending phase while recursion will have ascending as well as descending phase ,this is power of recursion

1>condition where we print value of n before fun call
it is called tail recursion .
2>condition where we print value of n after fun call
it is called head recursion.


Static and global variable are nearly same .
