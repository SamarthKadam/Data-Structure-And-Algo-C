4> Indirect Recursion
5>Nested Recursion

Tail recursion is same as that of loops.When the condition comes which two choose for the problem it is 
better to choose loop because its space complexities would be 1 and that of recursion would be (n).
Time complexities would be same.
like= 

===============
==============
===============
function(call);
This will execute statements in calling time


Head Recursion is not same as that of loops
like=

function(call);
================
================
================
This will exectue statements in return time.
