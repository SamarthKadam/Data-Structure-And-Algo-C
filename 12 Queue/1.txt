Queue is FIFO first in first out
if we want to insert something we insert in its rear end
if we want to delete something we delete it
from front end


1>Que using single pointer
It takes bigo of 1 for insert 
and it takes bigo of n for delete therefore we avoid it
2>Que using double pointer 
it takes bigo of 1

DE is double ended queue
It is where we don't follow que rule
