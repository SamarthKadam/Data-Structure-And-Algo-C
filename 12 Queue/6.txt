The priority que is list of elements who have their priority
Like in our case we consider smaller the element highest is its priority
There are two ways to implement them
1> is copy the order then delete it according to their priority
like 1 5,6;
This operation take bigo of n for searching
and bigo of n for shifting 

2>Copy the element in priority order like hightest prioirty element should come out 
first like in that manner
This operating takes inserting bigo of n
